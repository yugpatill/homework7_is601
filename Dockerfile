# Use the Python interpreter as the entrypoint and the script as the first argument
# This allows additional command-line arguments to be passed to the script via the docker run command
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "main.py"]
# this sets a default argument, its also set in the program but this just illustrates how to use cmd and override it from the terminal
